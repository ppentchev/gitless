gitless (0.8.6-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Add the path-none patch to catch up with pygit2's new behavior of
    returning None instead of raising a KeyError when not in a Git
    repository.  Closes: #907146
  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 4.2.0 with no changes.
  * Change the "MIT" license name to "Expat" in the copyright file to
    avoid ambiguity with the multiple versions of MIT-like licenses.
  * Add the typos patch to correct two typographical errors in
    the upstream source and also propagate the fix to the debian/gl.1
    manual page.
