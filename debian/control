Description: version control system on top of Git
 Gitless is an experimental version control system built on top of Git.
 Many people complain that Git is hard to use.  We think the problem lies
 deeper than the user interface, in the concepts underlying Git.
 Gitless is an experiment to see what happens if you put a simple veneer on
 an app that changes the underlying concepts.  Because Gitless is
 implemented on top of Git (could be considered what Git pros call
 a "porcelain" of Git), you can always fall back on Git. And of course
 your coworkers you share a repo with need never know that you're not
 a Git aficionado.
